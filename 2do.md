# To Do List

## REMEMBER

- **CSS SIDEBAR**: Ensure proper implementation.
- **PUSHHH**: Push changes frequently. Do not wait until there are too many changes to push.

## Image Generation: Oscar

1. **Opciones lugar (Done)**
   - Change the location of the options. Move them to the right in a vertical layout, similar to Figma.
   
2. **Prompt (Done)**
   - Ensure the prompt does not disappear but is reduced.
   - Make the prompt disappear when the image is loaded and display it within the image in a small size.
   
3. **Mostrar resultados (Done)**
   - Limit the display to 4 images.
   - Change the display to flex. If there is a single image, show it in large size. If there are three images, position them correctly.
   
4. **Aspect Ratio (Done)**
   - Instead of showing aspect ratios (1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9), display an image of how the result would look. It can simply be a frame.
   
5. **Estilos**
   - Show styles for each photo (presets) to visually see how each prompt would look.
